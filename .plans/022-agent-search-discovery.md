# agent/search discovery polish

## objective
Make `pi-async-compaction` easier for agents, google, npm, pi.dev, and github search to discover for Pi async/background/context compaction queries.

## status
- [x] inspect existing repo discovery files
- [x] add `llms.txt`
- [x] add/merge repo `AGENTS.md` discovery note if safe
- [x] add docs page with exact-match search phrases
- [x] add README FAQ/search phrases
- [x] expand npm keywords and github topics
- [x] run release gates
- [x] commit/tag/publish `0.1.3`
- [x] verify npm/pi.dev/github

## notes
No runtime behavior changes.

`AGENTS.md` already exists as untracked EDC orientation that references untracked `edc-context/`; committing or rewriting it would pollute the package with repo-local agent instructions. Discovery coverage is handled through `llms.txt`, README FAQ, package metadata, and docs page instead.
